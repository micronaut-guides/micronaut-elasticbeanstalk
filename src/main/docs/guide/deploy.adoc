Before you create the enviroment click "Configure more options". If you forget, you could change this after you created the environment.

By default, Micronaut applications will listen on port 8080. Elastic Beanstalk assumes that the application will listen on port 5000. There are two ways to fix this discrepancy: change the port Elastic Beanstalk is configured to use, or change the port the Micronaut application listens on. For this post, we will change the port the Micronaut application listens on.

The easiest way to do this is to specify the **MICRONAUT_SERVER_PORT** environment variable in the Elastic Beanstalk environment and set the value to 5000. (The configuration property name is `micronaut.server.port`, but Micronaut allows you to specify a more environment variable-friendly name).

On the Configuration page in your environment, under Software Configuration, click the settings icon.
